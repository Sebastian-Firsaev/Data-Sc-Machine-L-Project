The aim of this project is to delve into Irish crime trends and present straightforward statistical data and forecasts for the public, highlighting the crime rate in Ireland. Create user-friendly, interactive charts and graphs to visualize crime statistics, making it easier for the public to grasp the trends. I will attempt to utilize machine learning to anticipate upcoming crime hotspots and their corresponding rates.
